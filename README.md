This program uses the selenium module to scrape the web page www.worldometers.info/coronavirus to obtain information regarding the coronavirus numbers.
The numbers are then stored in a .txt file which is then emailed to the user every day.


**Heyyyy, update after 9 months (12/05/2021), I didn't know how to use APIs at the time (I didn't know they existed ^ _ ^ ;). So this project uses selenium to _open a chrome tab, read the values and then send them.......ikkkkkk its sooo badd but I was a beginner at the time so forgive me senpai_**
